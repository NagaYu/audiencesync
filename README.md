  <strong>Stop exporting CSVs of your customers' personal data.</strong><br/>
  AudienceSync extracts your high-value customers, hashes their PII <em>in memory</em> with SHA-256,
  and syncs them straight to <strong>Meta Custom Audiences</strong> and
  <strong>Google Customer Match</strong> — on a cron, with zero files on disk.

## 💣 The problem with manual CSV uploads

Most teams still sync audiences by hand. The workflow looks like this:

1. An analyst runs a SQL query and **exports a CSV of raw emails and phone numbers**.
2. The file lands in `~/Downloads`, gets attached to a Slack message, emailed to the agency, or
   parked in a shared drive.
3. Someone uploads it to Meta Ads Manager or Google Ads — often after re-saving it through Excel,
   which silently mangles phone numbers and leading zeros.

Every step above is a **data-protection incident waiting to happen**:

| Manual CSV workflow                | Why it's dangerous                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Raw PII written to a local file    | The file persists in Downloads, Trash, Spotlight indexes, and backups — long after the upload. |
| Shared over Slack / email / drives | PII is now copied across systems you don't control and can't reliably delete.                  |
| Hashing done "later" (or never)    | Many teams upload **un-hashed** emails, handing raw identities to a third party.               |
| Manual normalization               | Inconsistent casing, whitespace, and country codes **tank your match rate**.                   |
| Human-triggered, ad-hoc cadence    | Audiences go stale; yesterday's buyers aren't in today's lookalike seed.                       |

**AudienceSync eliminates the file entirely.** Data is read from the source, normalized, hashed,
and streamed to the ad platforms — all within a single process's memory. There is no CSV to leak,
because there is no CSV.

---

## ✨ Why teams love it

- **🔒 In-memory, file-free by design.** No CSV, no temp file, no staging table. PII exists only as
  transient values in RAM and leaves the process exclusively as **SHA-256 digests**.
- **🌊 Streaming, bounded memory.** Sources are read through server-side cursors (Postgres/MySQL) and
  lazy pagination (Stripe), then processed extract → hash → upload one batch at a time. The full
  audience is **never materialized at once**, so peak memory stays flat whether you sync 10 K or
  10 M records.
- **🧼 Platform-perfect normalization.** Emails and phone numbers are cleaned to the exact spec Meta
  and Google publish (trim → lowercase → E.164 country code) so your match rate is maximized.
- **📦 Smart batching + retries.** Records are chunked to each platform's limit and uploaded
  asynchronously with exponential backoff on 429/5xx.
- **🧩 Pluggable sources.** PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Stripe out of the box — pick one with an env var.
- **⏰ Cron or one-shot.** Run it manually for a backfill, or let the built-in scheduler keep your
  audiences fresh every night.
- **🛡️ Strict TypeScript.** `strict: true`, branded PII types, exhaustive switches — the compiler
  refuses to let raw PII flow where a hash is expected.

## ⚡ 10-second quick start

```bash
# 1) Install
npm install

# 2) Configure (copy and edit)
cp .env.example .env   # or just export the vars below

# 3) Build + dry-run (extracts & hashes, but uploads nothing)
npm run build
node dist/index.js sync --dry-run

# 4) Go live
node dist/index.js sync
```

Minimal `.env` for **Postgres → Meta**:

```dotenv
SOURCE_KIND=postgres
PG_CONNECTION_STRING=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db
PG_SSL=true

META_ENABLED=true
META_ACCESS_TOKEN=EAAB...
META_AUDIENCE_ID=23847...

LOOKBACK_HOURS=24
```

That's it. `audiencesync sync` will pull every customer whose `last_purchase_at` falls in the last
24 hours, hash them, and push them to your Custom Audience.

---

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NagaYu/audiencesync.git
cd audiencesync
npm install
npm run build      # compiles src/ → dist/ with tsup
```

Run directly with Node, or link the CLI globally:

```bash
npm link
audiencesync --help
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

```text
audiencesync sync       Run a one-shot extract → hash → upload for a time window
audiencesync schedule   Run sync repeatedly on CRON_SCHEDULE (long-lived process)
audiencesync config     Print the resolved, secret-redacted configuration
```

### One-shot sync

```bash
# Default window = now - LOOKBACK_HOURS → now
audiencesync sync

# Explicit window (ISO 8601)
audiencesync sync --since 2026-06-27T00:00:00Z --until 2026-06-28T00:00:00Z

# Validate everything without sending a single byte upstream
audiencesync sync --dry-run
```

### Scheduled sync

```bash
# Runs on CRON_SCHEDULE (default: every day at 02:00) in CRON_TIMEZONE
audiencesync schedule
```

Deploy it under PM2, systemd, a Docker `CMD`, or a Kubernetes `Deployment`. The scheduler skips a
tick if the previous run is still in flight, and shuts down cleanly on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration reference

All configuration is via environment variables (12-factor). `dotenv` auto-loads a local `.env`.

**Google auth — provide EITHER a static token OR refresh credentials:**

| Variable                                                             | Description                                                                                                                                             |

| `GOOGLE_ACCESS_TOKEN`                                                | A pre-fetched OAuth2 Bearer token. **Expires in ~1 hour** — fine for a manual one-shot run, unsuitable for cron.                                        |
| `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN` + `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` + `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | **Recommended for unattended cron.** AudienceSync exchanges these for a fresh access token on every run, so the scheduler never breaks on token expiry. |

> At least one of `META_ENABLED` / `GOOGLE_ENABLED` must be `true`. When Google is enabled you must
> supply either `GOOGLE_ACCESS_TOKEN` or the full refresh-token trio, or startup fails fast.

## 🧼 How normalization works

To maximize match rates, AudienceSync applies the rules both platforms publish — **before** hashing:

- **Email** → trim, strip internal whitespace, lowercase. (Gmail dots / `+tags` are preserved, as
  the platforms expect the address as entered.)
- **Phone** → strip every non-digit, drop national trunk `0`, prepend the calling code derived from
  the record's country (or `DEFAULT_COUNTRY`), validate E.164 length, hash the digits.
- **Name** → trim, lowercase, strip surrounding punctuation (keeping internal `'` and `-`).
- **Country** → ISO alpha-2, uppercased.
- **Zip** → trimmed/lowercased; US zips reduced to 5 digits. Sent **plain** to Google, **hashed** to
  Meta, per each platform's spec.

Records with neither a usable email nor phone are dropped — they can't be matched anyway.

---

## 🔐 Security model

- **No disk writes.** PII lives only in process memory and is emitted solely as SHA-256 hex.
- **No PII in logs.** Logs report counts and batch status, never identifiers.
- **TLS-by-default** to your database; certificate verification on.
- **Secret redaction.** `audiencesync config` masks every token and connection string.
- **Least privilege.** Use a read-only DB role and a restricted-scope Stripe key / Meta system user.

> **You are the data controller.** Ensure you have a lawful basis and the appropriate consent to
> share customer identifiers with Meta and Google, and honor deletion/opt-out requests at the source.

Issues and PRs are welcome. Please keep `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `npm test` green,
run `npm run format` before committing, and never log raw PII. See
